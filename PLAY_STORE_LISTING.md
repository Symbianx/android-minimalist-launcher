Reclaim your focus with Minimalist Launcher – a clean, distraction-free Android launcher designed to help you use your phone more intentionally.

🎯 WHY MINIMALIST LAUNCHER?

In a world of constant notifications and endless scrolling, Minimalist Launcher takes a different approach. Instead of bombarding you with widgets, news feeds, and app icons competing for attention, it shows you only what matters: the time, your battery status, and your essential apps.

By making apps deliberately accessible through search rather than instantly visible, this launcher encourages more mindful phone usage. You'll think twice before opening that social media app for the tenth time today.

✨ KEY FEATURES

• Clean Home Screen
Just time, date, and your favorite apps. No clutter, no distractions, no widgets pulling you in different directions.

• Smart Battery Indicator
A subtle circular indicator around your camera notch appears only when your battery drops below 50%. Stay informed without constant battery anxiety.

• Intuitive Gesture Navigation
- Swipe right-to-left: Open app search
- Swipe left-to-right: Return home with smooth animation
- Swipe up: Device search
- Swipe down: Notifications
- Smart keyboard: Automatically hides when scrolling search results

• Easy Favorites Management
Long-press any app in search to add or remove it from your home screen. Your most essential apps, always one tap away.

• Quick Access Shortcuts
Phone and camera apps are readily accessible in the bottom corners with satisfying press animations. Emergency calls and quick photos – always available.

• Clock Quick Access
Tap the time/date display to instantly jump to your alarm and clock app. Perfect for setting timers or checking alarms.

• Smooth, Modern Design
Built with Jetpack Compose for buttery 60fps animations and micro-interactions that feel responsive and polished.
