# Android Minimalist Launcher

Built totally using [github/spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit).

The goal of this project was to experience spec driven development with:
* An eco-system I haven't coded for in 10 years (Android);
* A programming language I have never tried (Kotlin);
* A stack I've never been profecient with (Mobile);
